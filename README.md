A Flutter application for testing vibration functionality. This project allows you to compare and verify Flutter's standard vibration features with third-party vibration library capabilities.

**ðŸŽ‰ This project is free to use!** Feel free to fork, modify, distribute, or use it in any way you like.

## Features

### Vibration Libraries Tested

1. **vibration library** - Third-party vibration control library
   - Custom pattern vibrations
   - Vibration intensity control
   - Detailed vibration settings

2. **HapticFeedback (Standard Library)** - Flutter's default haptic feedback
   - Light impact (lightImpact)
   - Medium impact (mediumImpact)
   - Heavy impact (heavyImpact)
   - Selection feedback (selectionClick)

### Test Functions

- **Vibration.vibrate Tester**: Test basic vibration functionality
- **VibrationPreset Tester**: Test preset vibration patterns
- **HapticFeedback Tester**: Test standard haptic feedback
